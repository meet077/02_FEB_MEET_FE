Q.20 What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?

Ans. 
- && (logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true, otherwise returns false. It stops evaluating as soon as it finds the first falsy value.

- || (logical OR): Returns true if at least one operand is true, otherwise returns false. It stops evaluating as soon as it finds the first truthy value.
