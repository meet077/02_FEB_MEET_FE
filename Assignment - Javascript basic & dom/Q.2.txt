Q.2 How many types of Variables in JavaScript?

A. In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare a variable:
- var: Function-scoped or globally-scoped, can be re-declared and updated.
- let: Block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared within the same block.
- const: Block-scoped, cannot be updated or re-declared; must be initialized during declaration.
