<!-- Q.30 What are the looping structures in JavaScript? Any one Example? -->

<!-- Ans. 
JavaScript has several looping structures:

- while loop
- do...while loop
- for...in loop (used for iterating over the properties of an object)
- for...of loop (used for iterating over iterable objects like arrays) -->

<!-- Example of a for loop: -->
<script>

    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
</script>
