Q.3 Define a Data Types in JS?

 JavaScript has several data types, which can be divided into two categories: primitive and non-primitive (or reference) types.

Primitive types:

- Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers (e.g., 42, 3.14).
- String: Represents a sequence of characters (e.g., 'Hello', "World").
- Boolean: Represents true or false values.
- Null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value.
- Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.

Non-primitive types:

- Object: Represents a collection of properties, including arrays, functions, and other objects.
