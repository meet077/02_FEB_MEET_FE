Q.57 how many type of JS Event? How to use it?

There are many types of JavaScript events, including:

1. Mouse events (e.g., click, dblclick, mouseover)
2. Keyboard events (e.g., keydown, keyup)
3. Form events (e.g., submit, change, focus)
4. Document and window events (e.g., load, resize, scroll)

To use an event, you typically attach an event listener to an HTML element using JavaScript. For example:

<script>
    document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
});
</script>
