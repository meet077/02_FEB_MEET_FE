(2) What is Redux Thunk used for?

Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This function can then perform asynchronous operations, such as API calls, before dispatching actions to the Redux store. It helps in handling complex synchronous logic and side effects in a Redux application.
