What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?

A Button Group in Bootstrap is a group of buttons that are visually grouped together, typically sharing the same styling and alignment. They are often used to group related actions or options, providing a more organized and user-friendly interface.

Basic Class for Button Group:

In Bootstrap , the basic class for creating a button group is "btn-group". This class is applied to a container element (such as a <div>) that wraps the buttons within the group. Additionally, Bootstrap provides variations of button groups, such as vertical button groups and button toolbar, which can be achieved by combining the "btn-group" class with other classes like "btn-group-vertical" and "btn-toolbar".

Example:

<div class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic example">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 1</button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 2</button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 3</button>
</div>

This example creates a basic horizontal button group with three buttons, each styled with the "btn btn-primary" classes.
